                Hello, my name is Steven Ortiz. I am a computer science major enrolled in Weber State
                University. I like to play games, watch television, and read books. 
                Typical student life. Sometimes I do those activities during homework. But ignore
                that last statement. It doesn't count.
            </p>
            <p>
                In any case, there's a certain list of books, games, and shows that I enjoy. Some
                of the media I consume I like to keep up to date with them or follow their
                social media page. I really their work and hope the can continue providing their
                fanbase with quality material.
            </p>
